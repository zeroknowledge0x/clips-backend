 *     attempt 1 → immediate
 *     attempt 2 → ~500 ms delay

 *     attempt 4 → ~2 000 ms delay

 *     resolve faster than FFmpeg / Cloudinary failures.
 *   - removeOnComplete: true — completed email jobs don't need auditing here
 *   - removeOnFail: false  — keep failed jobs for post-mortem inspection
